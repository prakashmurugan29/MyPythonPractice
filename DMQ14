Xinyou has been trained to drive now. Dr. Dexter wants to get to a national conference to present Xinyou. The venue of the conference is d km away from his workshop. He wants to know if Xinyou will be able to make it to the conference in 'h' hours, driving within the city speed limit 's'.

Write a Java program module that checks if he will be able to make it to the conference on time.

INPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 3 lines.

The first line of input is a floating point number d (0 < d < 32767), which corresponds to the distance. 

The second line of input is a floating point number s (0 < s < 32767), which corresponds to the speed limit.

The third line of input is a floating point number h (0 < h < 32767), which corresponds to the time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Output consists of a single string 'Yes', 'No' or 'Invalid Input'.

Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications. 

SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT:

100

25

5

SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 2:

150

-50

123

Invalid Input

SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 3:

100

50

1

No
SOLUTION:
#write your code here
d=float(input())
s=float(input())
t=float(input())
n=s*t
if(n>=d):
    print("Yes")
elif(0<n<d):
    print("No")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
