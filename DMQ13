Xinyou has been trained to drive now. Dr. Dexter wants to get to a National Conference to present Xinyou. The venue of the conference is x kms away from his workshop. He wants to know if Xinyou will be able to make it to the conference on time if he travels at y kms/h.

Write a Java program module that checks if he will be able to make it to the conference on time.

INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT: 

Input consists of 4 lines.

The first line of input is a floating point number corresponding to the distance 'd'. 0 < d < 32767.

The second line of input is a floating point number corresponding to the speed 's'. 0 < s < 32767.

The third line of input is a string corresponding to the time at which the conference begins â€“ 'ti'. 

The fourth line of input is a string corresponding to the current time, 'tj'.

'ti' and 'tj'  are strictly in the 'hh:mm' format (tj<ti).

Output consists of a single string 'Yes', 'No' or 'Invalid Input'.

SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 1:

100

25

16:00

10:00

Yes

SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 2:

150

50

10:00

16:00

Invalid Input

SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 3:

100

25

14:00

10:00

No
solution:
dis=int(input())
speed=int(input())
st=input()
ct=input()
time_taken=dis//speed
sh=int(st[0:2])#10:00 01231
ch=int(ct[0:2])#06
if(sh>ch):
    if((ch+time_taken)<sh):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
