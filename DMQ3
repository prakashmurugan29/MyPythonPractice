The newly appointed Vice-Chancellor of Anna University wanted to create an automated grading system for the students to check their grade. When a student enters a mark, the grading system displays the corresponding grade.

Write a program to solve the given problem.

Marks scored     Grade

100                        S

90 - 99                  A

80 - 89                  B

70 - 79                  C

60 - 69                  D

50 - 59                  E

<50                       F

Input format:

The input consists of one integer which corresponds to the marks scored by the student

Output format:

If a student marks greater than 100, print "Invalid Input". Otherwise, print the grade.

Sample Input:

78

Sample Output:

C
solution:
x=int(input())
if(x==100):
    print("S")
elif(x>=90 and x<=99):
    print("A")
elif(x>=80 and x<=89):
    print("B")
elif(x>=70 and x<=79):
    print("c")
elif(x>=60 and x<=69):
    print("D")
elif(x>=50 and x<=59):
    print("E")
elif(x<50):
    print("F")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
